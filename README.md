Code for the kaggle's Titanic competition - my ML learning sandbox

It all starts here:

The Hello World of Machine Learning. Never used so much time on a Hello World program as now. Happy to do so!

The repository has the following files:
a) run.py - runs the code
b) algorithms.py - each machine learning algorithm has its own function
c) feature_engineering.py - code that manipulates with the dataset's features to prepare a dataset for training
d) utility.py - utility functions for runing statistics on dataset and file manipulation
e) log.log - example of a log file - when running the code, a line is appended to the file. 
   The line consists of some basic information about the run itself
