Code for the kaggle's Titanic competition - my ML learning sandbox. The main idea is to work on feature engineering and with machine learning algorithms. 

It all starts here:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
The Hello World of Machine Learning. Never used so much time on a Hello World program as now. Happy to do so!

The repository has the following files:

a) run.py - runs the code

b) algorithms.py - each machine learning algorithm has its own function: Stohastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive      Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier

c) feature_engineering.py - code that manipulates with the dataset's features to prepare a dataset for training

d) utility.py - utility functions for runing statistics on dataset and file manipulation

e) log.log - example of a log file - when running the code, a line is appended to the file. 
   The line consists of some basic information about the run itself
   
f) ensemble_forest.py - ensemble models are here: - random forest, voting, bagging


The paths would need to be adjusted, if someone wants to run the code.
